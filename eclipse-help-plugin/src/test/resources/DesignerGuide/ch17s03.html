        <p>A process model can have multiple versions called process model versions. These
            versions allow to change a Xpert.ivy project without worrying about the compatibility of
            currently running cases on the Server. How does this work? When an Xpert.ivy project has
            been finished or reached a milestone, it is going to be deployed as the first process
            model version. Users can use this project, they start processes. Some of the processes
            may last long time (weeks, months, or even years). While these processes (e.g. cases)
            are running, the project may be enhanced and might have now incompatible changes to the
            first version. Now the changed project can not be deployed to the first version but to a
            new configured version. Consequently old cases must not be stopped, they will be still
            executed within the first process model version. Meanwhile new cases are started from
            the new deployed version.</p>
        <p>A process model version has a release state. The release state of a process model
            version is responsible how the version is used by the system. The most important release
            state is the state <span class="bold"><strong>RELEASED</strong></span>. Within a process model
            only one version can be in this state. All processes that are started in a process model
            are started in the released process model version! A complete list of release state can
            be found in the following list:</p>

                            this process model version will continue to run in this version. As soon
                            as all cases of this version have been ended, the state will change to
                            ARCHIVED automatically.</td></tr><tr><td>

                            in this process model. Consequently, this version is now not in RELEASED
                            state anymore but has been ARCHIVED. Actually the server administrator
                            can change a process model version from state ARCHIVED back to state
